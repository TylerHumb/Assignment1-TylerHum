    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
     <p>My ideal job is working as a machine learning technician for the ministery of defence <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56335330?type=standout#sol=36a46cceecd712851dabbcd04ec6cc54340c8285">LINK HERE</a> </p>

    <h3>About this job</h3>
      <p>This job is about developing and training artificial intelligence  using machine learning.
        the job is for ‘defence’ technologies for   the australian department of defence. The job is obviously very secretive
        about the exact nature of the projects that you would be working on specifically but it does mention that the position
        would be specifically focusing on naval warfare, presumably in a defensive context rather than offensive (hopefully)</p>
</div>
     <br>
<div class="para">
     <h3>What made this position appealing to me?</h3>
      <p>I am super interested in Machine learning and artificial intelligence so this job was automatically appealing to me,
         i am also interested in the software behind many of the instruments of war and the navy has some pretty interesting examples
          of this eg heat seeking torpedos and SAM batteries</p>
</div>
     <br>
<div class="para">
     <h3>Skills, qualifications and experience required:</h3>
      <p>According to the application form the ideal applicant would have skills in all of the following fields and experience in at least one of them:</p>
      <ul style="text-align:center">
        <li>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Software Development and Design</li>
        <li>Mathematical Modelling and Simulation</li>
        <li>Mechanical or Systems Engineering</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I currently have no skills nor experience in any of these fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="para">
    <h3>Plan to acquire those skills</h3>
       <p>I will likely have to finish my uni course with a focus on machine learning or artificial intelligence,
         and then get a job in that field to gain experience. Alternatively I could also gain experience in these
         fields through work experience at a place that works in those fields. Either way I would need to ensure
         that my education also covers all the fields I require experience in.</p>
