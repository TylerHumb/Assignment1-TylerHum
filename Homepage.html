    <h2 style="text-align:center;"> <b>About me</b> </h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;">My name is Tyler Humbert or s3947682 if you want to keep it formal or something.
       I am from a small town in rural Victoria which only had around 400 residents, it only
      had 2 businesses, a supermarket and of course a pub. Due to the size of my town
       I had to go to secondary school in a different town called rochester which was around
      a half hour away. Naturally since i'm in IT i like video games (currently playing risk of rain 2)
       and have been playing them most of my life. I also have 4 pets back at home 2 cats, Marcus and Toby and 2 dogs, Bayley and Holly</p>
