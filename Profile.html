   <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
    <p>Honestly these test results mean very little for me, this is because i believe
     that there is no way to 100% accurately determine someone's personality due to their
     own self biases whilst answering the questions, even while i was answering the
     questions was often unsure about what i actually felt towards some of the questions.
     Despite this i suppose that this test gives you a very loose basis on your personality type.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
    <p>I doubt that these results will have little to no influence on my behaviour in a team,
      these tests are the equivalent to astrology so letting them influence your behaviour would be
      foolish, the only possible effect  I could see this test having on my behaviour would be being more
      self aware of my actions. Unless this question is refering to role delegation or something? in which
     case i spose you could use these results as a justification for delegating certain people certain roles</p>
   <br>
   <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p>Well even though i don't believe in the complete accuracy of the tests i can acknowledge that the test
      can give you a loose idea on a person's personality type. Knowing this i should group up with people who
      have the opposite results from me, therefore complimenting my personality type and offering an opposing viewpoint
      to my ideas, therefore allowing the best ideas to prosper. </p>
