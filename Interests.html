  <br>
    <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your Interest in It start?</h3>
     <p>My particular interest in IT is in the area of machine learning and AI technologies, this interest started after
        watching a bunch of videos on the topic on youtube which really sparked my interest in the particular area, seeing
       the program itself dictate what's best for what situation itself was really interesting for me. Due to my rural upbringing
       i have very limited experience in IT, specifically programming where the only experience i really have is with scratch (please don't laugh lmao)</p>

    <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</h3>
     <p>To be honest there is no specific reason why I came to RMIT, I never went to any open day, hell I hadn't even
        seen the buildings before coming on my first day. The only reason i came to rmit was because my friends where all
        going there too and i figured it wouldn't really matter too much</p>

    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
     <p>During my studies in this course I expect to learn how to read, write,
       debug and test/trial programs for computers, phones and whatever else you would
       write a program for. I also expect to learn some things about severs and other
       likewise technology but due to my extremely limited knowledge in that area i don't
       really know what i would learn about them</p>
